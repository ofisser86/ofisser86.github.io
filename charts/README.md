About Highcharts
Highcharts is a SVG-based, multi-platform charting library that has been actively developed since 2009. It makes it easy to add interactive, mobile-optimized charts to your web and mobile projects. It features robust documentation, advanced responsiveness and industry-leading accessibility support.

<h2>FEATURES</h2>
 
 - Backend-agnostic - 
 All our charting libraries works with any back-end database or server stack. Data can be given in any form, including CSV, JSON or loaded and updated live.
Wrappers for most popular languages, such as .Net, PHP, Python, R, and Java, as well as iOS, are available from Highcharts or our community.

Responsive across devices - Default responsiveness goes beyond fitting the chart to the dimensions of its container, but automatically finds an optimal placement for non-graph elements such as legends and headings.

Accessibility - Highcharts sports the industryâ€™s most sophisticated accessibility support for visually impaired users, and users with keyboard navigation only, meeting and exceeding both Section 508 requirements and WCAG 2 guidelines.

Touch optimized - Touch-optimized charts allow for a native experience on mobile and touch screens. Single touch-drag for data inspection, multi-touch for zooming, and more.

Options are optional - In most cases, charts look and behave exactly as you need without any modifications. For anything else, a simple options-structure allows for deep customization.
Highcharts is also extendable and pluggable for experts seeking advanced animations and functionality. Check out some advanced customizations in our community section, and plugins in our our extensions directory.

Flexible styling - Our elegant charts render crisp and clear at any resolution and are easily styled via JavaScript or CSS.

Export & Print - With the exporting module enabled, your users can export the chart to PNG, JPG, PDF or SVG format at the click of a button, or print the chart directly from the web page.

BigData Ready - When your chart has thousands of datapoints, you may enable WebGL powered chart rendering through our free Boost module, and experience speed that leaves Plotly, dygraphs and other performance-focused charting libraries in the dust.

Dynamic - Numerous events supply hooks for programming against the charts, making it easy to demonstrate complex relationships between data with live, dynamic updates of data and customizable animations.
Data can be handled over to Highcharts in any form, even from a different site, and a callback function used to parse the data into an array.

Full-blown editors for end users - The free Highcharts editor enables developers to embed a full-featured charts editor to their CMS or web app with just a few lines of code. The Highcharts Cloud service is a hosted app with an intuitive editor, chart storage and embedding for anybody who wants to create and publish charts.

Open Source - One of the key features of Highcharts is that under any of the licenses, free or not, you are allowed to download the source code and make your own edits. This allows for personal modifications and a great flexibility.
